title: Why a new syntax?
description: Learn about some of the drawbacks of classic diff code blocks and how remark-auto-diff tries to solve them.
---

`remark-auto-diff` is a [remark](https://remark.js.org/) plugin providing an alternative syntax to author `diff` code blocks in Markdown.

## `diff` code blocks

Using `diff` code blocks in Markdown is very common in many projects, especially in documentation and guides.
A fenced code block (a block with three backticks <code>```</code> at the start and end) using the [`diff` language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format) can be used to highlight changes:

- Additions are prefixed with a plus sign (`+`) at the start of the line.
- Deletions are prefixed with a minus sign (`-`) at the start of the line.

````mdx frame="terminal" title="Markdown Code Editor"
```diff
- console.log('removed line')
+ console.log('added line')
```
````

The above example would be rendered as:

```diff
- console.log('removed line')
+ console.log('added line')
```

I personally think this syntax has some drawbacks:

- It requires the user to be familiar with the `diff` syntax.
  I have received some feedback from users who were confused by it, wondering how the `+` and `-` signs works with indentation, etc.
- Authors need to compute the diff manually.
  If the user only has the “before” and “after” versions of the code, they need to manually write the diff between the two versions.
- Updating the diff is also not straightforward as the user needs to recompute the diff manually.
  It's impossible to just copy-paste the updated code.
- Syntax highlighting of the code is lost.
  The example above contains JavaScript code, but syntax highlighting for JavaScript is not used in both the editor and the rendered output.
- Auto-formatting is not possible.
  Code formatter which supports formatting Markdown files (like Prettier) can also format the code inside code blocks.
  The example above contains JavaScript code, but Prettier will not format the code as such.

## Expressive Code

[Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com) is an amazing code block renderer bundled with many features: themes, syntax highlighting, text markers, editor & terminal frames, and many more.
If you are not already using it, I highly recommend you to check it out.

When it comes to `diff` code blocks, Expressive Code has done a great job at improving the experience of authoring and rendering them to the limit of what is possible for a code block renderer.

### Syntax Highlighting

Expressive Code supports [syntax highlighting in `diff` code blocks](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/text-markers/#combining-syntax-highlighting-with-diff-like-syntax).
A second language identifier can be specified in the opening code fence to enable syntax highlighting.

The following example uses the `lang="js"` attribute after the opening code fence to specify that the code inside the `diff` code block is JavaScript code:

````md frame="terminal" title="Markdown Code Editor"
```diff lang="js"
- console.log('removed line')
+ console.log('added line')
```
````

The above example would be rendered with syntax highlighting as:

```diff lang="js"
- console.log('removed line')
+ console.log('added line')
```

Unfortunately, as awesome as the feature is, syntax highlighting will only be visible in the rendered output.
When editing the Markdown file, the JavaScript code will not be highlighted as such as visible in the first code example.

### Line markers

Expressive Code also supports [line markers](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/text-markers/#selecting-line-marker-types-mark-ins-del).
Instead of using the `+` and `-` signs of the `diff` syntax, users can use the `ins` and `del` markers to highlight added and removed lines by specifying line numbers in the opening code fence.

The following example uses the `ins={1}` to specify that the first line is an addition and `del={2}` to specify that the second line is a deletion:

````md frame="terminal" title="Markdown Code Editor"
```js ins={1} del={2}
console.log('removed line')
console.log('added line')
```
````

The above example would be rendered with changes highlighted as expected:

```js ins={1} del={2}
console.log('removed line')
console.log('added line')
```

This syntax improves on many points I mentioned previously:

- The user does not need to be familiar with the `diff` syntax and deal with the `+` and `-` signs.
- Syntax highlighting is respected in both the editor and the rendered output.
- Auto-formatting is possible as the code is using the `js` language identifier and does not contain any `+` or `-` signs.

Although this syntax is much better than the `diff` syntax, I personally think it still has some drawbacks:

- Authors need to compute the diff manually.
- Authors need to compute line numbers manually to specify the `ins` and `del` markers.
- Updating the diff is also not straightforward as the user needs to recompute the diff manually and update the line numbers.

## `remark-auto-diff`

`remark-auto-diff` uses a different approach to author `diff` code blocks in Markdown.
Two adjacent code blocks are used to specify the “before” and “after” versions of the code and the plugin will compute the diff automatically.

Considering the following example:

````mdx frame="terminal" title="Markdown Code Editor"
```diff
- console.log('removed line')
+ console.log('added line')
```
````

When using `remark-auto-diff`, a first code block is used to specify the “before” version of the code immediately followed by a second code block to specify the “after” version of the code.
The `auto-diff` attribute is added to the opening code fence of both code blocks to specify that the plugin should compute the diff automatically.

The above example can be rewritten as:

````mdx frame="terminal" title="Markdown Code Editor"
```js auto-diff
console.log('removed line')
```

```js auto-diff
console.log('added line')
```
````

When rendered by Expressive Code, the above example would be rendered as:

```js auto-diff
console.log('removed line')
```

```js auto-diff
console.log('added line')
```

While being more verbose, this syntax improves on many points I mentioned previously:

- The user does not need to be familiar with the `diff` syntax and deal with the `+` and `-` signs or the `ins` and `del` markers from Expressive Code.
- Authors do not need to compute the diff manually.
  Spotting code issues is also easier as the user can just look at the “before” and “after” code blocks without any extra diff syntax.
- Updating the “before” or “after” code is straightforward as the user can just copy-paste the updated code.
- Syntax highlighting is respected in both the editor and the rendered output as both code blocks are using the `js` language identifier.
- Auto-formatting is possible as both code blocks are using the `js` language identifier and do not contain any `+` or `-` signs.
